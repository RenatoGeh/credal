# The structure of programs {#program_md}

A [Program](@ref pasp.program.Program) is essentially a triple \f$\langle L,P,Q\rangle\f$, where
\f$L\f$ is the solely logic part of the program, \f$P\f$ are probabilistic facts, rules and
annotated disjunctions, and \f$Q\f$ are queries to be made from the program.
